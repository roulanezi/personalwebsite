**_Divided Nations: The Cultural Foundations of Affective Polarisation_**

BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grants

Duration: 01 April 2023 -- 30 September 2024

Partisan polarisation has been a fact for most Western democracies but recently supporters of opposing
parties view not only the party but also the supporters of that party negatively. This phenomenon called
“affective polarisation”, describes a type of polarisation encompassing citizens' negative emotional reactions -
animosity- towards an out-group on the basis of the party they support. Several recent studies have reported
an increase in affective polarisation in many European societies but what explains this phenomenon? In this
project, I propose an alternative theoretical explanation hypothesising that affective polarisation, is also a byproduct
of cultural divides cutting across partisan lines. The politicisation of cultural identities is increasingly
aligned with a partisan identity to a degree that they now divide the new left and far-right voters. This pilot
project will serve the purpose of a first small-scale empirical test that will be used to prove the viability of my
theory.

**_Cultural divides: Understanding the role of affective polarisation_**

Our project aims to situate developments in Greek public opinion in a comparative perspective, and examine
how cultural issue cleavages have realigned around such new partisan identities. In doing so, our aim is to
examine the extent to which social polarisation on issues that measure the logic of a “culture war” narrative
prevail over those that measure “economic” issues and interests. We propose that one way to evaluate the
extent of political and societal polarisation, and its effects, is by examining how individuals identify themselves
on a dimension from “liberalism” to “conservatism”, and will then explore how this continuum relates to group
identities and polarisation over time. After having established evidence for polarisation between liberal and
conservative identities, we will ask what factors are responsible for producing and sustaining these changes, and
finally, how they manifest in contemporary partisan identities.
