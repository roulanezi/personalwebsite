**_Cultural divides: Understanding the role of affective polarisation_**

Our project aims to situate developments in Greek public opinion in a comparative perspective, and examine
how cultural issue cleavages have realigned around such new partisan identities. In doing so, our aim is to
examine the extent to which social polarisation on issues that measure the logic of a “culture war” narrative
prevail over those that measure “economic” issues and interests. We propose that one way to evaluate the
extent of political and societal polarisation, and its effects, is by examining how individuals identify themselves
on a dimension from “liberalism” to “conservatism”, and will then explore how this continuum relates to group
identities and polarisation over time. After having established evidence for polarisation between liberal and
conservative identities, we will ask what factors are responsible for producing and sustaining these changes, and
finally, how they manifest in contemporary partisan identities.
