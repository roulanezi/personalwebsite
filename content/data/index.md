Kostas Gemenis and Roula Nezi, November 2011 - January 2012 

The aim of this study is to estimate the ideological and policy positions of political parties in Greece during the ‘Great Recession’. The survey includes expert estimates regarding parties’ positions on general ideological and specific policy scales (Left-Right, social and moral issues, state intervention in the economy, environment, immigration, European and foreign policy, etc) as well as estimates of party leader positions and internal party dissent on the issue of solving the debt/deficit problem. The data are comparable to previously conducted expert surveys on political parties.
