<font size="-"> Welcome to my personal web-site. Here you will be able to find links to my articles, CV, and current projects.</font>

<font size="-">I am Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in Political Science at the University of Surrey and a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. My research examines developments in public opinion and political attitudes, political parties and party systems, and electoral behaviour. I am also interested in survey methodology and quantitative methods. My academic work has been published in a wide range of Q1 journals.

<font size="-"> I am also an elected Trustee of the UK Political Studies Association (PSA) - Leading trustee on Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion  and I was the co-convenor of the Greek Public Opinion and Parties Group. In 2020, I was awarded the Political Science Association Innovation in Quantitative Methods Teaching Prize and I also won the Early Career Teacher of the Year award (FASS).
