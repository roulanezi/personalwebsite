**COURSES ON ADVANCED RESEARCH METHODS:**

**ECPR Course on Age-Period-Cohort models**

22 February-1 March 2019, Bamberg, Germany

This course is designed to give participants a deep knowledge of Age-Period-Cohort (APC) Models. Those are models that help social scientists to examine whether time-varying changes in social and political phenomena are due to the biological and social process of aging (age effects), social or economic factors, for example, an economic crisis (Period effects) or due to the unique experience of a group, for example children socialised under an authoritarian regime (cohort effects). What makes the analysis of those effects interesting and methodologically challenging is the so-called “identification problem”; The age-period-cohort conundrum refers to the problem of separating the effects of age, periods and cohorts. Upon completion of the course participants will have an understanding of the identification problem in the study of aging and cohort analysis and an understanding of the different methods developed to overcome the identification problem. Participants will also be familiar with the limitations of these methods and will also be able to know which method to use depending on their own research question.



**ECPR Course on Survey Design**

2-9 March 2018, Bamberg, Germany

This course introduced students to the theory and the practicalities of survey design. The course used the Total Survey Error scheme as the main theoretical framework and based on that discussed survey sampling, mode selection, question and questionnaire design, fieldwork implementation; non-response and data archiving.
