This paper examines the way framing provided by populist leaders can activate certain political attitudes towards austerity. Accepting that the key mechanism in populist framing is the ability to attribute blame to other agents, we argue that populism is about the redistribution of anger (Pappas 2014). Therefore our main research question is: Does the framing of austerity policies affect the way those policies are perceived by the general public? We employ a vignette social experiment where stories represent real situations (leaders’ official statements on austerity in Greece) to elicit voters’ preferences and judgments.\nInterested to learn more about our research on austerity politics?

The theory of economic voting suggests that voters will support the party in government when the economy is good but will vote against the incumbent when the economy is deteriorating. In a context of a severe economic crisis, we examine how fluctuations at the level of unemployment affect the vote for the party in government. We do so by using a survey experiment were we manipulate the level of unemployment.\nLAB EXPERIMENTS\nPolitical Attitudes and the Breakdown of Cooperation: Evidence from a Public-Good game\nThis paper presents a public good game that can be used to introduce players to the conflict between social incentives to provide to the public good and constraints from individual incentives and political attitudes.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2a89b5245bec194c990d5951bf0956ec","permalink":"/experiments/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/experiments/","section":"","summary":"SURVEY EXPERIMENTS\nAcceptance of austerity policies: Evidence from a survey experiment\nWhat drives people to accept or resist austerity?

Solidarity and De-solidarization in Germany and Europe” (short: SoliKris)\nEuropean countries have experienced a set of severe crises over the past years. The research project Solikris (Change through Crisis? Solidarity and desolidarization in Germany and Europe) is based on two main assumptions: First, despite the lack of a causal connection between the various crises, there is a significant overlap and reinforcement of their effects and influence on the society, politics, and the behaviour of European states to each other. Second, all these crises have one thing in common. They have influenced the feeling of solidarity within the society as it presents itself among individuals, social groups and to an extreme form also European states. The drop of solidarity could lead to an extreme desolidarization. However, in some cases, the crises lead to increasing solidarity. This is a question that needs to be treated empirically. The central research question of Solikris is: What are positive and negative effects on solidarity within a society and between European countries that have brought the various crises since 2006? This question allows us to identify positive and negative influences and the conditions and circumstances under which they were made possible.\nFunded by: Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) Duration: 1.12.2017 – 30.11.2020 SoliKris is a collaborative research project bringing together more than a dozen social scientists from the GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, the University of Heidelberg, and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.\nPolitical Parties and Interest Groups in Southern Europe. (2016 -)\nThe project’s main goal is to analyze the relationship between parties and interest groups using a comparative and longitudinal approach. Third-wave Southern European democracies (Greece, Portugal, and Spain) will be used to address the following questions: How have political parties interacted with interest groups? What is the evolution of this linkage over time, in particular after the emergence of the recent economic crisis? Which factors can explain party-group interactions? How can we explain variation across different parties and countries? The empirical research is based on extensive data collection which includes not only the organizational dimension but also an examination of leadership profile, as well as new data collected through a questionnaire to interest groups and elite interviews. The final aim is to assess potential causes of party-group linkages, considering sociological, institutional and actors’ strategy as the main explanatory factors.\nDesigning \u0026amp; Operating an Infrastructure for the Empirical Inquiry of Political \u0026amp; Social Radicalism in Greece (2012-2015) This project aimed to empirically record political and social radicalism in Greece during the economic crisis years. Data have been collected by telephone interviews conducted in January 2015 prior to the 25 January 2015 Parliamentary Elections.\nAccess to data: Political \u0026amp; Social Radicalism in Greece: First Round Political \u0026amp; Social Radicalism in Greece: Second Round Political \u0026amp; Social Radicalism in Greece: Third Round\nINTUNE: Integrated and United?

The project aimed at studying the changes in the scope, nature, and characteristics of citizenship that result from the process of the deepening and enlargement of the European Union. During that time I was working as a research assistant for the Greek team, for the research area of the project concerning national elites.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"/projects/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"(SELECTION OF PROJECTS I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED OR I AM CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN) Preference Matcher\nPreferenceMatcher is an academic consortium involving political scientists, social psychologists, computer scientists, and communication specialists from the University of Zurich, University of Twente, Cyprus University of Technology and Oxford Brookes University who collaborate in developing e-literacy tools designed to enhance voter education.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"UNDERGRADUATE AND MASTER COURSES:\nUniversity of Surrey\nResearch in Practice (POLM011) SS\nResearch Methods (POL2028) SS\nEconometrics (POL2045) WS\nCompanion Website for modules in quantitative methods: www.roulanezistats.com\nElectoral Systems and Voting (POL2046) SS\nUniversity of Konstanz and Cologne Business School\nEmpirical Social Research, Cologne Business School, WS 2016 Radical right parties in Europe, University of Konstanz, WS 2014 Political representation in Western Europe, University of Konstanz, SS 2014\nCOURSES ON ADVANCED RESEARCH METHODS:\nECPR Course on Age-Period-Cohort models\n22 February-1 March 2019, Bamberg, Germany\nThis course is designed to give participants a deep knowledge of Age-Period-Cohort (APC) Models. Those are models that help social scientists to examine whether time-varying changes in social and political phenomena are due to the biological and social process of aging (age effects), social or economic factors, for example, an economic crisis (Period effects) or due to the unique experience of a group, for example children socialised under an authoritarian regime (cohort effects). What makes the analysis of those effects interesting and methodologically challenging is the so-called “identification problem”; The age-period-cohort conundrum refers to the problem of separating the effects of age, periods and cohorts. Upon completion of the course participants will have an understanding of the identification problem in the study of aging and cohort analysis and an understanding of the different methods developed to overcome the identification problem. Participants will also be familiar with the limitations of these methods and will also be able to know which method to use depending on their own research question.\nECPR Course on Survey Design\n2-9 March 2018, Bamberg, Germany\nThis course introduced students to the theory and the practicalities of survey design.
